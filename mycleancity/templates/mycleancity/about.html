              We are a national multi-pillar program, that collaborates with existing environmental organizations, to engage, enable and evaluate youth volunteer actions with the goal of building a more environmentally sustainable future--an environmental leadership program run by YOUth for YOUth, with measurable results!

              Differing from other environmental initiatives, My Clean City is a merit and results-based endeavor; beyond simply raising awareness of core environmental issues, My Clean City strives to quantify youth impact through the recording of results and the crediting of students and organizations that assist in environmental goals. Together—through this collaborative effort— we can reduce Canada’s environmental impact and inspire others towards a cleaner country!
