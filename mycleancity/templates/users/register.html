If you are using MyCleanCity on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you are nevertheless individually bound by this Agreement even if your company has a separate agreement with us. If you do not want to register an account and become a MyCleanCity Member, do not enter into this Agreement, do NOT click "Register" and do not access, view, download or otherwise use any MyCleanCity webpage, information or services. By clicking "Register" (or "Sign In " or similar), you acknowledge that you have read and understood the terms and conditions of this Agreement and that you agree to be bound by all of its provisions.

    <h3 class="section">2.3 Emails That Discriminate</h3>    
    <p>Any emails that discriminate by virtue of any protected classification including race, gender, nationality, religion, and so forth, will be dealt with according to the harassment legislation in your legal jurisdiction.</p>
