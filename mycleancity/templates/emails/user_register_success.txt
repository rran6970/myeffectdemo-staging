Hey {{ first_name }},

Welcome to My Clean City! 

The official countdown is on!

Starting April 1st, you can take action by signing up for Clean Acts that are posted in our Challenge Centre and compete with friends to become our Top National Champion.

Best of all you already have a head start! Your early registration has earned you 50 BONUS CleanCreds and the opportunities don't stop here. Although our Clean Acts don't open until April, by choosing to be a Clean Champion, you can earn bonus CleanCreds for sponsoring Clean Teams organized by your friends or school. 
Don't forget to follow us via Facebook (/mycleancity1), Twitter (@MyCleanCity1) and Instagram (@MyCleanCity) for important updates, contests and bonus CleanCred giveaways.

Stay Connected!
